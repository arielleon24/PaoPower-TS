This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

run npm install to install dependencies 

Then run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The form has a username, email and password field that are all required before it can be submitted. 
Once the form is submitted the user is redirected to another page thanking them for registering. 

In the top right corner, the language switch button is found that will switch the entire page to French and back to English when pressed again. 

The "REGISTERED USERS" link redirects to the API/users route that is meant to hold all the users currently registered on the app
